## Introduction

Do you often forget about products in your home/office that expire or reach their sell by date? Do you look for a solution to keeping track of all the expiration dates? My Perishable Planner can assist you with:

- Writing down expiration/sell by dates.
- Tracking when products expire.
- Notify you when a product expires and needs replacing.

Use your Android Device to log an item via picture,barcode, or name. Enter an expiration date. Track all items and see how much time they have till expired. Get notified when items begin to expire or need replaced.
